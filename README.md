This module enables you to craft Beet deeplinks for prompting the user to sign+broadcast blockchain operations.

There are multiple examples for the Bitshares blockchain included in the `examples/BTS` folders.

Deeplinks are broadcast-only, so don't expect any automated response to a 3rd party app from a launched deeplink.
